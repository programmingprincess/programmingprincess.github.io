My research projects span bioinformatics, data mining, and machine learning, and use mostly python, bash, and sometimes R. My web projects are mostly full-stack, built with JavaScript and occasionally Flask. 

Some of my current and past projects, arranged from most to least recent. Open source projects are linked to GitHub.
